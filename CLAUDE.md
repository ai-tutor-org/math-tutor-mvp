# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Preview production build**: `npm run preview`
- **Lint code**: `npm run lint`
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: `npm run deploy`

## Architecture Overview

This is a React-based educational application for teaching perimeter concepts, built with Vite. The app uses a lesson-based architecture with interactive components and TTS (Text-to-Speech) functionality.

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **Modular Content Management**: All lesson content is organized in `src/content/` with separate files for lessons and presentation groups, imported through `src/content/index.js`
- **Component-based Interactions**: Interactive elements are implemented as reusable components in `src/components/` that can be dynamically rendered based on content data
- **State-driven Progression**: The lesson flow is controlled by state indices (`currentPresIndex`, `currentInteractionIndex`) that track progress through structured content
- **Dynamic Layout System**: The UI can switch between `full-screen` and `dual-panel` layouts depending on the interaction type
- **Individual CSS files for each component**

### Core Data Structure

The content system has three levels:
1. **Lessons**: Top-level containers with sequences of presentations (`lessons` object)
2. **Presentations**: Groups of related interactions (`presentations` object)
3. **Interactions**: Individual learning activities with tutor dialogue and optional interactive components

### Navigation Flow

The app follows this user journey:
1. Home (`/`) → Chapter selection
2. InteractiveLesson (`/lesson/:lessonId`) → Main learning experience

### Key Technologies

- **React 18** with hooks and functional components
- **React Router DOM** for navigation
- **Framer Motion** for animations and transitions
- **Matter.js** for physics simulations
- **PIXI.js** for advanced graphics rendering
- **Web Speech API** for text-to-speech functionality

### Component Architecture

- **TutorAvatar**: Animated tutor character with speaking/waving states
- **TTSManager**: Handles text-to-speech with callbacks for speech lifecycle
- **Interactive Components**: Specialized components like `RoomIllustration`, `RulerMeasurement`, `ShapeMeasurement` that handle specific learning activities
- **Layout System**: Components can request layout changes (e.g., switch to dual-panel view)

### State Management

The app uses React's built-in state management with:
- Lesson progression state (`currentPresIndex`, `currentInteractionIndex`)
- UI state (`layout`, `isSpeaking`, `showNextButton`)
- Dynamic content state (`dynamicTutorText` for answer feedback)

If you want to add new presentations or interactions, follow best practices from @adding-new-presentations.md.

**Important Notes:**
- All TTS content must be in the `src/content/` files for pre-generation by `generate_audio.py`
- IDs must be unique across all presentations
- ContentComponents need to be imported at the top of presentation files in `src/content/presentations/`
- Update `componentMap` in `InteractiveLesson.jsx` if using new interaction types
- Except for conditional transitions, in all the other manual transitions, the CTA should come on the left column, not the right.
- After all the interactions of a presentation are made, connect them with each other
- **TTS Rule**: Never call `triggerTTS()` manually - TTSManager automatically triggers TTS when `dynamicTutorText` changes, so only use `setDynamicTutorText()`
- When changing anything in an interaction, see if there is some corresponding code custom written for this interaction in `InteractiveLesson.jsx`

**Content Structure:**
```
src/content/
├── index.js                     // Main export point
├── lessons.js                   // Lesson structure
└── presentations/
    ├── index.js                 // Combines all presentations
    ├── 01-introduction.js       // Standard units intro
    ├── 02-measurement.js        // Measurement practice
    ├── 03-shape-sorting.js      // Shape sorting game
    ├── 04-farmer-missions.js    // All farmer missions
    ├── 05-shape-designer.js     // Shape designer challenges
    └── 06-summary.js            // Lesson summary
```

**Content Guidelines**
- Try to keep most text content on left hand side (which the tutor will speak) along with the CTAs to move to next, or an input box as required for the transition
- Right hand side is mostly for games and other complex interactions


### Deployment

The app is configured for GitHub Pages deployment with:
- Base path set to `/math-tutor-mvp/` in `vite.config.js`
- Router basename configured in `App.jsx`
- Deployment script in `package.json`
